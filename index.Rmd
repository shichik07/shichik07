I am a PhD student in the Department of Neurology at Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg, currently transitioning into a career as a Data Analyst. My doctoral research focuses on investigating cognitive symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), with a particular emphasis on decision-making and cognitive control abilities.

In my academic work, I employ a multifaceted approach combining behavioral experiments and EEG recordings. I utilize a wide array of advanced analytical methods, including Bayesian statistical modeling and Drift-Diffusion model analyses, which has laid a strong foundation for my transition into data analytics.

My research experience involves processing and interpreting complex neurological data, skills that I'm now leveraging as I move into the field of data analysis. This transition allows me to apply my expertise in extracting insights from intricate datasets to a broader range of industries and problems.
