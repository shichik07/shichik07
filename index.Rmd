I am a final year PhD-Student at the department of Neurology at Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg. I investigate cognitive symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Particularly the impact of PD on decision-making- and cognitive control abilities.  For my research I use a mix of  behavioral experiments, EEG recordings and a wide array of analysis methods, including Bayesian statistical modeling and Drift-Diffusion model analyses.
