I investigate cognitive symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) with a focus on decision-making- and cognitive control abilities. For my research I use a mix of behavioral experiments, EEG recordings and a wide array of analysis methods, including Bayesian statistical modeling and Drift-Diffusion model analyses.\n\n\n\n",

Adaptive control has been studied in Parkinson’s disease mainly in the context of proactive control and with mixed results. In our project we compared the ability of participants with Parkinon’s disease to age matched healthy control participants. We found evidence for proactive control to be generally impaired in PD and reduced abilities to modulate conflict information in reactive control.\nFrequency effects of deep brain stimulation in Parkinson’s disease\nHigh frequency deep brain stimulation is successfully used in Parkinson’s disease for the treatment of motor symptoms. Previous research has suggested that cognitive capabilities may possibly be modulated by low frequency stimulation with a peak frequency in the theta band (4 Hz). We were interested whether these low frequency stimulation effects may be band specific and affect different cognitive domains when using a peak frequency in the beta band (20 Hz). Using a selection of behavioral task we found no effect in the previously indicated cognitive control domains, but distinct improvements response selection abilities.\nCan individuals with Parkinson’s disease use prior information in their decision-making?\n\n\n\n",
